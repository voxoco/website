        California Online Privacy Protection Act

      <p class="text-voxo-gray pb-6 pt-2">
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
        policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States
        (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
        consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
        those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more

      COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

    <p class="text-voxo-gray pb-6 pt-2">
      When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old,
      the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
      United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites
      and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
    </p>
    <p class="text-voxo-gray pb-6 pt-2">
      We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. Do we let third-parties, including ad

      Fair Information Practices

      The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts

      the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy
      laws that protect personal information.

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-einabold">
      In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

      We will notify you via email within 7 days
    </p>
    <p class="text-voxo-gray pb-6 pt-2">
      We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue
      enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
      not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
      courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
